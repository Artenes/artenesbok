This is part of teh **Milage Project**, where for each application or exercise I develop during the next 6 months I'll have to write an in depth article explaining how the app was made, any problems I've faced during development and all the new stuff I've learned.

This time we got **Todroid**, an android app to manage tasks.

# Todroid

## Requirements

An android application to insert, mark as done and delete tasks on a list.

## Restrictions

- use **Kotlin**.
- customize the look and feel (do not use default widgets styles).
- do not use any database, store all data in **SharedPreferences**.
- make use of **Observable pattern** to send data from **SharedPreferences** to the ui.
- do not use **ViewModel** class.
